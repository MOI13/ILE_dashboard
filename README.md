## Project Description

- The indications for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in neonates differ significantly from those in children and adults due to their small blood volume and vulnerability to even minimal physiological stress.

- For newborns, particularly preterm infants who were born before 37 full gestation weeks, RBC transfusions are commonly administered to address a wide range of conditions, such as improving oxygen delivery in cases of anemia or replacing blood volume lost due to trauma or surgery.

- We aim to address: 1) How are baby and mother demographic characteristics associated with infant red blood cell transfusion? 2) How does the infant’s hemoglobin level change with red blood cell transfusion? 3) How does the infant’s body weight change with red blood cell transfusion?
